# Protocol Buffers Repository

This will include the protobuff files for synchronizing the data from T2 Cloud to retailware, the following is the defined protobuffs files:

1. Order
2. Picker app setting

This repository is dedicated to housing the Protocol Buffers (protobuf) files for our project. Protocol Buffers, developed by Google, are a flexible, efficient, and automated mechanism for serializing structured data â€“ think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. They are language-neutral, platform-neutral, and provide a way to encode data schemas that are less error-prone than other methods.

These protobuf files define the structure of the data we use in our project, ensuring consistent data interchange between services. They are used in our communication protocols, data storage, and more. By centralizing our protobuf files in this repository, we aim to maintain consistency and clarity across our project's services.

Feel free to explore the protobuf files and contribute to the development and enhancement of our data structures.
